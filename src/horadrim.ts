  `Long ago, the Soulstones were given to the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. They were used to bind the three Prime Evils. I now know that even these holy artifacts were no match for Diablo's power.

I hope that his two brothers are more securely held... but I fear the worst.`,
  `Regrettably, I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which devastated Tristram. It would appear that our greatest fears have come to pass. Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world!

As you know, some time ago Diablo was slain beneath Tristram. And when our hero emerged triumphant from the labyrinth beneath town, we held a grand celebration that lasted several days.

Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof. He kept his distance from the rest of the townsfolk and seemed to lapse into a dark, brooding depression. I thought that perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing that he simply could not put it out of his mind.

The hero seemed more tormented every passing day. I remember he awoke many times -- screaming in the night -- always something about 'the East'.

One day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were slain, and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.

I believe now that Tristram's hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.

I fear even worse, my friend... I fear that Diablo has taken possession of the hero who sought to slay him. If true, Diablo will become more powerful than ever before.

You must stop him or all will be lost.`,
  `It is certain that we face the demon queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their ancestral Monastery. This does not bode well for us, my friend.

Ancient Horadric texts record that Andariel and the other Lesser Evils once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing them from Hell to our world. Here, they caused mankind untold anguish and suffering before they were finally bound within the Soulstones.

Andariel's presence here could mean that the forces of Hell are once again aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. If this is true, then I fear for us all. You must kill her before the Monastery becomes a permanent outpost of Hell and the way east lost forever.`,
  `Diablo is heading east for some foul purpose. And the only passage east is through the Monastery gate. Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel to block any pursuit.

For her part Andariel hopes to win Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are always vying for positions of power within the unholy hierarchy!`,
  `It is clear that Andariel is acting on behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone from following him eastward. Her defeat would allow you to continue the pursuit.

Ancient lore has it that while Andariel was spawned in the Burning Hells, she is not fond of fire.`,
  `This is a great victory indeed, but many more battles await. I will accompany you on your journey, lending what assistance I can...

Remember... Diablo is still out there, seeking something in the desert. I'm afraid that this nightmare will not end until you find what it is that he seeks.`,
  `The Horadrim used to mummify their highest mages, and infuse them with spells that would allow them to protect their tombs, even after death.

I have no idea why one of them would be acting so malevolently. Perhaps Drognan or Fara would know more about this.`,
  `Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a fortunate turn of events...

As the last living Horadrim, I alone have knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...

The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off his burial Chamber from the mortal realm. Those same Mages also crafted fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued them with the special power to open the Chamber's hidden door.

After nearly losing one to the thievery of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all the Horadric Staves into two parts - wooden shaft and metal headpiece - hiding them seperately to safeguard them.

The Horadrim foresaw our current plight and designed the hiding places to reveal themselves to worthy heroes like you.

Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff and unite them using a Horadric Cube. Then you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.`,
  `You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube. According to Horadric lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric Staff.

To do it - use the Cube as you would a scroll. When the Cube opens, place both pieces of the Staff into it and use the Cube's transmute power.

You'll be pleased to know that the Cube has other alchemical uses as well...

Six gems plus one sword transmute into a socketed long sword.

You may also transmute two quivers of arrows into crossbow bolts into one quiver of arrows, while two quivers of arrows yield one quiver of bolts.

I must leave it to you to discover other formulae.`,
  `The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my friend. You have discovered the shaft portion of a Horadric Staff.

I trust you know how to use a Horadric Cube to unite the shaft with its headpiece.`,
  `The Viper amulet you bear is actually the headpiece of a Horadric Staff!

Yes... You have an uncanny knack for finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of course, you'll have to use a Horadric Cube to combine the headpiece with the shaft.`,
  `Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff.

Carry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. Find within the Tomb the chamber whose floor is inset with the Circle of Seven Symbols.

Place the Staff into the receptacle you find there. That will open the secret passage into Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.

But, be prepared for a fight - you'll likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy Baal.`,
  `I've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and I sense that he is becoming more and more agitated by something. You should try to talk to him again.

If he still won't take you into his confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit more. I gather that his respect for you is growing.`,
  `I've been thinking about the problems in Jerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has occurred to you as well...

If those cellar passageways lead to the Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where the demons came from. Horazon's haven must have been breached!`,
  `The appearance of the mage you describe sounds like one I met back in Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Perhaps, this is one of them.

You know, fate seems to have frowned upon all of the heroes who confronted that terrible Evil. Take care or the same may happen to you.`,
  `I hope that this false Summoner found peace in death. Unfortunately, it is more likely that he will be dragged down into Hell by the demons he was bound to.

Let this be a lesson to you... Demonic magic is a quick path, but its powers are seductive and deadly.`,
  `Diablo nears his goal. We have little time to lose.

Remember, my friend, that Adariel gave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. It would be prudent to assume that the other Evils will attempt to aid their master as well.`,
  `The Archangel Tyrael was the one who gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim two hundred and sixty years ago.

It is highly unusual for the forces of Heaven to so directly interfere with man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to act of his own volition. We have never been able to discern why.

Perhaps, he goes against the consensus of Heaven because he doubts our ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, he sees more threat than his peers.

Where the actions of Hell often seem straightforwardly bent on destruction, the motives of Heaven are unfathomable.

Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal must be stopped before they join with their brother, Mephisto. If the three Prime Evils unite once again, the world as we know it will be no more.`,
  `I've not set foot in glorious Kurast for many years. But I never would have imagined it could be so corrupted.

Certainly, this must be Mephisto's work! You'd best get going, my friend. Diablo and Baal are still out there and you must find them.`,
  `Drognan told me about Hratli when we were in Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves magic into his forge and produces mystical weapons and armor.

His skills could be quite useful to you.`,
  `Judging from his dress and strange markings, I would guess that Ormus is from the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet none of the others here seem to know that he is a sorcerer.

The Taan were once as powerful as the Vizjerei clan, but their studies were even more secretive. I wonder what he's hiding.`,
  `Have you met Natalya? She appears to be a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a secret order that has been around for centuries... almost as long as the Horadrim itself.

Her presence here makes me uneasy, for they are traditionally sworn to hunt down Magi who have betrayed the trust of their order.

I wonder why she is here.`,
  `I've read legends about a sage named Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of life beyond death.

If I remember correctly, his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette. It was a very strange tale.`,
  `Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he had a fondness for jade figurines. On his trading voyages he collected an odd assortment of such small statues.

I would show him your figurine.`,
  `Never forget that your ultimate purpose here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian Tower that is located within the Temple City of Travincal.

Know this, friend. The only way to gain entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy the artifact known as the Compelling Orb.

Mephisto used this device to control the Zakarum Priests and their followers. The Orb can only be destroyed with an ancient flail imbued with the spirit of the one incorruptible priest.

Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto worked his evil corruption on the Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to his dark ways, save one Khalim, the Que-Hegan of the High Council.

Mephisto directed the other Council priests to slay and dismember Khalim and then scatter his remains across the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, eventually becoming the embodiment of Mephisto here on the mortal plane.

The corrupted High Council fashioned an Orb to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to hide the lair of their master from mortals.

Your task is to collect the scattered relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his relics.

Once this is accomplished, you must destroy the Compelling Orb with Khalim's Will to open the way into the corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.`,
  `Ahh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal the true path to Mephisto.

Place the Eye in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Heart, the Brain, and the Flail.`,
  `This is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain knows Mephisto's weakness.

Place it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Heart, and the Flail.`,
  `You have found Khalim's Heart, and it still bears the courage to face Mephisto!

Place it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Brain, and the Flail.`,
  `Once properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal the way to Mephisto.

Place it into the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's relics - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute them to carry out Khalim's Will.`,
  `Masterfully done, hero! You have crafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to destroy the Compelling Orb and open the way to Mephisto.

May the true Light guide your way.`,
  `I've done some research on the Taan mage-clan, and it seems that most of their magical studies were focused on Skatsimi rites.

If anyone is qualified to use the powers of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.`,
  `Ridding Kurast of the Council of Zakarum was essential. Still, there is more you must do. The Compelling Orb, too, must be destroyed.

Diablo and Baal must be close to finding their brother, Mephisto, by now. You've no time to waste.`,
  `You must reach Mephisto before his brothers do. The ancient Horadrim always feared that the Three would escape their prisons and unite. I can't believe that I, the last of their Order, have seen it come to pass.

You are the only one who can prevent this, my friend. The final hour draws near.`,
  `Our faith in you was well deserved. But Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it is likely that Baal followed him there.

Enter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord of Terror before all is lost. Only then will our world be saved!`,
  `Can you believe this place? Did you ever dare to dream that you'd one day stand upon the crossroads between Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium Fortress is truly miraculous.

However, your journey is not yet over. Diablo still roams free in Hell, marshalling his demonic forces. Only when he is beaten will our world finally have peace.

Hurry now... the sands of time slow for no one!`,
  `I have read much about the enigmatic Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in Horadrim lore both for his compassion for mortals and his unquenchable spirit.

It was rumored that he went against the wishes of Heaven and gave the Horadrim the original Soulstones in order to trap Diablo and his brothers.`,
  `Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual the Fallen? He must have great faith in your abilities!

I trust you know what you're doing... Be careful. You're our last hope.`,
  `Having trouble finding the Fallen Angle, eh?

You'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel like some great evil is permeating the air around here.`,
  `You're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is imperative that you find and stop Diablo!

You should speak of this with Tyrael. He will know what to make of this.`,
  `The time has come to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone!

Although I picked it up before entering the Infernal Gate, I believe you should carry out this crucial mission.

Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.

Only by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.`,
  `The time has come for you to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone!

Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.

Only by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.`,
  `Congratulations, hero!

Surely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the fury unleashed when you smashed his Brother's Soulstone.`,
  `You don't have time to dally about here!

Diablo awaits you in Hell. Remember... Diablo's greatest weapon against you is Terror.

Don't give in to your fears. Resist his power and put an end to him for good!`,
  `I knew there was great potential in you, my friend. You've done a fantastic job.

Though my ancestors often struggled against the Three Evils and their minions, I've always lived a shut-in, scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom aided you.

Now, I wish to leave this place. Though Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, I hope I won't have to see them again for many, many years.

Please talk to Tyrael about leaving this place now!`,
  `I am amazed to find this place so untouched. Everything else in the path of Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in ruin.

These Barbarians must indeed be the legendary guardians of Mount Arreat, They are a proud, hardy people. Don't expect to be greeted warmly -- strangers here rarely are.

Perhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend some time with the townsfolk and try to understand them better. I'll let you know what I discover.`,
  `Though these Barbarians are known throughout the kingdoms as ferocious fighters, they are also capable of great compassion.

They have trained throughout history for a battle their legends foretell will decide the fate of the world.`,
  `The angel Tyrael has watched over the guardians of Arreat throughout history. I do not believe that Baal and Tyrael have come to fight over a paltry few souls.

They are here to settle a conflict as old as time itself.`,
  `During my time with the Horadrim, we often debated the nature of Mount Arreat.

We knew that the Barbarian clans zealously guarded the mountain as their sacred duty. However, many dismissed their zeal as simple superstition...combined with an inborn hostility toward outsiders.

Those Horadrim who trekked up Arreat were never heard from again...Still, I do not believe they died at the hands of the Barbarians.`,
  `All users of magical arts know of Mount Arreat, but few understand its true nature. It is the nexus of an unfathomable magic.

It bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction races to its summit with such purpose. I fear for the whole world should Baal gain what he seeks.`,
  `I have spent decades trying to understand the forces at work in this world. But in the face of all that is transpiring, I realize how meager my knowledge is.

I will be of assistance where I can, my friend.`,
  `Though the Elder Council of Harrogath is gone, there are many capable young leaders to take their place.

Anya certainly has enough courage and intelligence to lead them all, if they can survive this catastrophe.`,
  `Ah, Anya. Such a fine example of feminine strength...

She reminds me of the Zakarum priestesses I knew in my youth. They don't take vows of chastity, you know.`,
  `It is fortunate that this town has such a talented smith.

The quality of Larzuk's work surely complements your skills. In fact, he would have been quite welcome among the Horadrim.`,
  `I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak speaks with a venomous tongue and acts as of the entire weight of this town rests upon his shoulders.

Perhaps there is more going on here than we know.`,
  `For one so young, Anya commands great respect. Now that she is here, I will make it a point to talk to her about Mount Arreat.

You should do the same.`,
  `Regretfully, I know very little about this Relic. However, if what the others say is true, then Baal must not gain possession of it.

Stop Nihlathak...before all is lost.`,
  `Ohh...This is a truly horrible turn of events.

I know it seems you have always been one step behind, my friend. But look at it this way...You have evil on the run.`,
  `Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal Rasha, one of the most powerful of the ancient Horadrim.

Your battles with Mephisto and Diablo will pale in comparison to your battle with Baal.

The Lord of Destruction aided by Tal Rasha's knowledge...The mountain itself will tremble when you clash.`,
  `I knew in time you would defeat Baal. You have done everything you set out to do, my friend.

Ever since you rescued me from Tristram, I have believed in you. It has been a supreme honor to aid you along the way.

So...The Worldstone was corrupted by Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. Worry not. Though whatever lies ahead I have faith that the Light will guide us both.

Go, now, back to the Worldstone chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael has opened for you.`,
